# terraform-aws-iam-cross-account-dest





This is a terraform module that creates a role that can be assumed by other accounts.


---


This project is part of the [Guardian Project Ops](https://gitlab.com/guardianproject-ops/) collection.









It's free and open source made available under the the [BSD 3-Clause](LICENSE.md) license.




## Introduction


This module creates a role named by the `iam_role_name` variable. This role
can be assumed by accounts defined in the `source_accounts` variable.



## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://gitlab.com/guardianproject-ops/terraform-aws-iam-cross-account-dest/-/tags).



```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "git::https://gitlab.com/guardianproject-ops/terraform-aws-iam-cross-account-dest?ref=master"

  iam_role_name   = "infra"
  source_accounts = {
    "account-alias" : {
      id: 12345678
      }
  }
  context         = module.this.context
}

```
